## Program Description
Elevens is a card game. You have to select the index number (1-9) of a card, and match it.
The way to match cards is to achieve a score of 11 (2-10, Aces are 1, facecards don't count).
You can also select three facecards to achieve a match.
The game ends either when the deck is empty (you win!), or when you have no matches left (defeat!).
Instructions are available on the main menu.
